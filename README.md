# Requirements
- [Tensorflow 1.1.0rc0](http://www.tensorflow.org)

# Basic Usage
To train with default parameters on the tinyshakespeare corpus, run:
```bash
python train.py
```

To sample from a trained model
```bash
python sample.py
```

To pick using beam search, use the `--pick` parameter. Beam search can be
further customized using the `--width` parameter, which sets the number of beams
to search with. For example:
```bash
python sample.py --pick 2 --width 4
```
